`bunt` offers macros to easily print colored and formatted text to a terminal.
It is just a convenience API on top of [`termcolor`](https://crates.io/crates/termcolor).
`bunt` is implemented using procedural macros, but it does not depend on `syn` and its compilation is fairly quick (â‰ˆ1.5s on my machine, including all dependencies).

*Minimum Supported Rust Version*: 1.46.0

```rust
// Style tags will color/format text between the tags.
bunt::println!("I really like {$yellow}lemons{/$}! Like, {$blue+italic}a lot{/$}.");

// To style a single argument, you can also use the `{[style]...}` syntax. This
// can be combined with style tags.
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
bunt::println!("Here is some data: {[green]:?}. {$bold}Length: {[cyan]}{/$}", v, v.len());
```

## Status of this project

This is still a young project, but I already use it in two applications of mine.
The syntax is certainly not final yet.
